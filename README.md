# Laptop-Sales-for-past-six-months

The aim of this project is to determine the top three best selling brand products(PC) and where the products are selling mostly whether from ONLINE or OFFLINE. Another aim is to find out the type of PC processor that is selling most for the months.

I used Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Excel to carry out this project by cleaning the raw data, and using appropriate charts, colour for the visualisation.
